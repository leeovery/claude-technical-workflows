# Gather Context

*Reference for **[start-discussion](../SKILL.md)***

---

Gather context based on the chosen path.

#### If starting new discussion (from research or fresh)

```
New discussion: {topic}

Before we begin:

1. What's the core problem or decision we need to work through?

2. Any constraints or context I should know about?

3. Are there specific files in the codebase I should review first?
```

**STOP.** Wait for responses before proceeding.

#### If continuing existing discussion

Read the existing discussion document first, then ask:

```
Continuing: {topic}

I've read the existing discussion.

What would you like to focus on in this session?
```

**STOP.** Wait for response before proceeding.
