# Findings Review & Fix Discussion

*Reference for **[technical-investigation](../SKILL.md)***

---

Present your analysis to the user for validation, then collaboratively agree on fix direction. Simple bugs flow fast (2 STOP gates). Complex bugs expand naturally through discussion.

## A. Present Findings

Summarize the investigation findings in a structured display. Pull from the investigation file — do not invent or embellish.

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
Investigation Findings: {topic}

Root Cause:
  {clear, precise root cause statement}

Contributing Factors:
  {factor 1}
  {factor 2}

Blast Radius:
  Directly affected:  {components}
  Potentially affected: {components sharing code/patterns}

Why It Wasn't Caught:
  {testing gap, edge case, recent change}
```

Do these findings match your understanding?

- **`y`/`yes`** — Findings are correct, discuss fix direction
- **Or provide feedback** on what's off or unclear.
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

#### If the user provides feedback

Address their concerns directly. Re-trace code paths if needed. Provide supporting evidence from the code trace. Update the investigation file with corrections or new information, and commit.

Re-present findings using the same format above.

#### If yes

→ Proceed to **B. Fix Direction Discussion**.

## B. Fix Direction Discussion

Present what the analysis surfaced about how to fix this. Let the findings guide the shape — there's no required number of approaches:

- **One obvious fix?** Present it clearly with trade-offs and any risks.
- **Multiple viable approaches?** Present each with trade-offs so the user can compare.
- **Unclear?** Say so — this is a discussion, not a presentation.

Use a code block. Format naturally based on what there is to present — a single approach doesn't need numbered alternatives, multiple approaches benefit from comparison structure.

What are your thoughts?

- **`y`/`yes`** — Agree with this direction
- **Or provide feedback** to discuss, challenge, or suggest alternatives.
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

#### If the user provides feedback

Engage collaboratively. Stay bounded — focus on:
- Challenging assumptions about approaches
- Surfacing edge cases and risks
- Exploring how fixes interact with existing code
- Understanding user priorities (speed, safety, maintainability)

Do not go into implementation detail — that belongs in the specification. When discussion reaches a natural decision point, summarize the agreed direction and present for confirmation.

#### If yes

Document the Fix Direction section in the investigation file:

1. **Chosen Approach**: The selected approach with deciding factor
2. **Options Explored**: All approaches presented (including unchosen ones with brief "why not")
3. **Discussion**: Journey notes — user priorities, concerns raised, edge cases surfaced, what shifted thinking. Brief for simple bugs, detailed for complex.
4. **Testing Recommendations**: Informed by the discussion
5. **Risk Assessment**: Informed by the discussion

Commit the updated investigation file.
