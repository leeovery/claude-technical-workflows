# Context Resurfacing

*Reference for **[spec-construction](spec-construction.md)***

---

When you discover information that affects **already-logged topics**, resurface them. Even mid-discussion — interrupt, flag what you found, and discuss whether it changes anything.

If it does: summarize what's changing in the chat, then re-present the full updated topic. The summary is for discussion only — the specification just gets the clean replacement. **Standard workflow applies: user approves before you update.**

> **CHECKPOINT**: Even when resurfacing content, you MUST NOT update the specification until the user explicitly approves the change. Present the updated version, wait for approval, then update.

This is encouraged. Better to resurface and confirm "already covered" than let something slip past.
