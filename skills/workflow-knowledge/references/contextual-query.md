# Contextual Query

*Reference for **[workflow-knowledge](../SKILL.md)** — loaded at phase start in research, discussion, and investigation processing skills.*

---

At the beginning of these phases, a single targeted query against the knowledge base catches prior work that might otherwise surface as a correction ten minutes into the session. One query, one interpretation step — if nothing comes back, proceed as normal.

This is **not** a speculative dump. It is a focused check using the best context currently available.

## A. Construct the query

Build a short natural-language description of what this phase is about using whatever context you have at hand: the topic description, the handoff context, bootstrap answers already captured, the problem statement, and — for investigation — the initial symptoms.

Follow the construction rules in **[knowledge-usage.md](knowledge-usage.md)** — **B. How to construct queries** (natural language, not slugs; batch for multiple angles). If you have several distinct framings, batch them in one call.

If the only context available is a topic name, construct the best descriptive query you can. A poor query that returns nothing is acceptable — the cost is one store load.

## B. Run the query

Invoke the CLI with the constructed query (or queries). Use `--work-unit {work_unit}` to bias results toward the current work unit without filtering out cross-work-unit context. Do not use hard filters unless you have a specific reason — this is meant to surface prior work broadly.

```
node .claude/skills/workflow-knowledge/scripts/knowledge.cjs query "<descriptive query>" --work-unit {work_unit}
```

#### If the command exits with a non-zero code

Load **[knowledge-usage.md](knowledge-usage.md)** for **D. Query failure handling** and follow its instructions. When D returns:

- **If the user chose `skip`** — no results to interpret. → Return to caller.
- **If a retry succeeded** — results are now available. → Proceed to **C. Interpret the results**.

#### Otherwise

→ Proceed to **C. Interpret the results**.

## C. Interpret the results

#### If stdout is `[0 results]`

No prior context found. Proceed to the next step silently — no delay, no user noise.

→ Return to caller.

#### If results are returned

Read each chunk and weigh it against the current topic. For a chunk that looks load-bearing, read its source file (the `Source:` line) for full detail. Most results are context — one or two may be directly relevant.

Briefly acknowledge surfaced context to the user before the main session starts:

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
> Surfaced prior context from the knowledge base — incorporating into this phase.
> {One short line naming the most relevant piece, e.g. "auth-flow decided on UUID identity (spec, 2026-03-15)."}
```

Carry the context forward into the phase. Do not dump the full chunk list to the user — summarise only if the user asks, or if a chunk materially changes how this phase should start.

→ Return to caller.
