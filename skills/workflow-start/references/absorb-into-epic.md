# Absorb Feature into Epic

*Reference for **[manage-work-unit](manage-work-unit.md)***

---

Merge a feature's discussion into an existing epic as a new topic, then remove the feature entirely.

## A. Select Target Epic

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
> This will move the feature's discussion into the selected epic as
> a new topic and delete the feature work unit. Git history serves
> as provenance.

· · · · · · · · · · · ·
Select a target epic:

@foreach(epic in available_epics)
- **`{N}`** — {epic.name:(titlecase)}
@endforeach

- **`b`/`back`** — Return
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

#### If user chose `b`/`back`

→ Return to caller.

#### If user chose a number

Store the selected epic as `target_epic`.

→ Proceed to **B. Name Topic**.

## B. Name Topic

Default topic name = `{selected.name}` (the feature's work unit name).

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
Topic name in **{target_epic:(titlecase)}**: **{selected.name}**

- **`y`/`yes`** — Use this name
- **`r`/`rename`** — Enter a different name (kebab-case)
- **`b`/`back`** — Return
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

#### If user chose `b`/`back`

→ Return to caller.

#### If user chose `y`/`yes`

Set `topic` = `{selected.name}`.

→ Proceed to **C. Collision Check**.

#### If user chose `r`/`rename`

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
Enter topic name (kebab-case):
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

Set `topic` to the user's input.

→ Proceed to **C. Collision Check**.

## C. Collision Check

Check if a discussion topic with this name already exists in the target epic:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-manifest/scripts/manifest.cjs exists {target_epic}.discussion.{topic}
```

#### If `true`

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
Topic "{topic}" already exists in {target_epic:(titlecase)}.
Enter a different name (kebab-case):
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

Set `topic` to the user's input.

→ Return to **C. Collision Check**.

#### If `false`

→ Proceed to **D. Research Warning**.

## D. Research Warning

Check if the feature has research:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-manifest/scripts/manifest.cjs exists {selected.name}.research
```

#### If `true`

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
> Research files for this feature won't be moved — their value is
> already captured in the discussion. They will be deleted with the
> feature directory.
```

→ Proceed to **E. Confirm**.

#### Otherwise

→ Proceed to **E. Confirm**.

## E. Confirm

Read the discussion status:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-manifest/scripts/manifest.cjs get {selected.name}.discussion.{selected.name} status
```

Store the result as `discussion_status`.

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

## F. Execute Absorption

Execute the following operations in order:

```bash
mkdir -p .workflows/{target_epic}/discussion/
```

```bash
mv .workflows/{selected.name}/discussion/{selected.name}.md .workflows/{target_epic}/discussion/{topic}.md

Register the topic in the epic manifest:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-manifest/scripts/manifest.cjs init-phase {target_epic}.discussion.{topic}
```

**If `discussion_status` is `completed`:**

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-manifest/scripts/manifest.cjs set {target_epic}.discussion.{topic} status completed
```

Remove the feature from the project manifest:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-manifest/scripts/manifest.cjs delete project.work_units.{selected.name}
```

Remove the feature directory:

```bash
rm -rf .workflows/{selected.name}/
```

Commit: `workflow({selected.name}): absorb into {target_epic}`

→ Proceed to **G. Post-Absorption**.

```
