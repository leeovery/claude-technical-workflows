Starting new investigation.

What bug are you investigating? Please provide:
- A short identifier/name for tracking (e.g., "login-timeout-bug")
- What's broken (expected vs actual behavior)
- Any initial context (error messages, how it manifests)
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

Control returns to the main skill.
