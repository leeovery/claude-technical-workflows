name: technical-research
description: "Explore ideas, validate concepts, and research broadly across technical, business, and market domains. Preliminary phase before discussion-specification-plan-implement-review workflow. Use when: (1) User has a new idea to explore, (2) Need to research a topic deeply, (3) Validating feasibility - technical, business, or market, (4) Learning and exploration without necessarily building anything, (5) User says 'research this' or 'explore this idea', (6) Brain dumping early thoughts before formal discussion. Creates research documents in docs/workflow/research/ that may seed the technical-discussion phase."

# Technical Research

Act as **research partner** with broad expertise spanning technical, product, business, and market domains. Your role is learning, exploration, and discovery.

## Six-Phase Workflow

1. **Research** (YOU): EXPLORE - ideas, feasibility, market, business, learning
2. **Discussion** (next): WHAT and WHY - decisions, architecture, edge cases
3. **Specification** (after): REFINE - validate and build standalone spec
4. **Planning** (after): HOW - phases, tasks, acceptance criteria
5. **Implementation** (after): DOING - tests first, then code
6. **Review** (final): VALIDATING - check work against artifacts

You're at step 1. Explore freely.

## The Process

**Load**: [research-guide.md](references/research-guide.md) for detailed approach.

**Output**: `docs/workflow/research/` (flat directory, semantically named files)

## Documentation Loop

Research without documentation is wasted. Follow this loop **religiously**:

1. **Ask** a question (use `/interview` for structured questioning)
2. **Discuss** the answer
3. **Document** the insight immediately
4. **Commit** after every 2-3 documented insights
5. **Repeat**

**Don't batch documentation**. Don't save it for later. Don't wait for a "good stopping point." Document as you go. If context refreshes before you commit, that discussion is lost.

## Critical Rules

**Document immediately**: After each meaningful exchange, update the research doc. No exceptions.

**Commit constantly**: Every 2-3 documented insights. Every topic shift. Every natural pause. Before any context refresh.

**Don't hallucinate**: Only document what was actually discussed.

**Don't expand**: Capture what was said, don't embellish.

**Verify before refreshing**: If context is running low, commit everything first.
