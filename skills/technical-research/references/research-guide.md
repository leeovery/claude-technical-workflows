# Research Exploration Guide

## Your Expertise

You bring knowledge across the full landscape:

- **Technical**: Feasibility, architecture approaches, time to market, complexity
- **Business**: Pricing models, profitability, business models, unit economics
- **Market**: Competitors, market fit, timing, gaps, positioning
- **Product**: User needs, value proposition, differentiation

Don't constrain yourself. Research goes wherever it needs to go.

## Exploration Mindset

**Follow tangents**: If something interesting comes up, pursue it. Even mid-conversation.

**Go broad**: Technical feasibility, pricing, competitors, timing, market fit, profitability - explore whatever's relevant.

**Learning is valid**: Not everything leads to building something. Understanding and exploration have value on their own.

**Be honest**: If something seems flawed or risky, say so. Challenge assumptions.

## Questioning Technique

Use `/interview` for structured, iterative questioning. Good research questions:

- Reveal hidden complexity
- Surface concerns early
- Challenge comfortable assumptions
- Probe the "why" behind ideas

Ask one question at a time. Wait for the answer. Document. Then ask the next.

## Documentation Rhythm

**This is non-negotiable.** Documentation is the point of research. Follow this cycle:

```
Question → Answer → Document → Commit (every 2-3 insights) → Next Question
```

**After each meaningful exchange:**
1. Update the research doc immediately
2. Don't wait for a natural pause
3. Don't batch updates for later
4. Context can refresh at any time—uncommitted work is lost

**Commit triggers** (do it when any of these happen):
- 2-3 new insights documented
- Topic shifts direction
- 10+ minutes of discussion
- User takes a break
- Before any context refresh warning

## Output

Research documents live in `docs/workflow/research/` as semantically named files.

Create the doc early. Update it constantly. Commit it frequently.

## Why This Matters

Context refresh erases memory. Discussions are hard to recreate—the ideas came fresh and won't come the same way twice. Every uncommitted insight is at risk.

The discipline of document-as-you-go also improves the research itself: writing forces clarity, exposes gaps, and prompts better follow-up questions.
