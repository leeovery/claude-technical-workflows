# Research Session

## Session Loop

Research is a conversation. Follow this loop:

1. **Ask** — Pose a question to the user, probing the topic from a relevant angle
2. **Discuss** — Engage with the answer, challenge assumptions, explore implications
3. **Document** — Update the research file with insights, findings, and open questions
4. **Commit** — Git commit after each write. Don't batch.
5. **Repeat** — Continue with the next question or follow where the conversation leads

## Convergence Detection

#### If work_type is `epic`

Research threads naturally converge. As you explore a topic, options narrow, tradeoffs clarify, and opinions start forming. This is healthy — but it's also a signal.

Watch for these signals that a thread is moving from exploration toward decision-making:

- "We should..." or "The best approach is..." language (from you or the user)
- Options narrowing to a clear frontrunner with well-understood tradeoffs
- The same conclusion being reached from multiple angles
- Discussion shifting from "what are the options?" to "which option?"
- You or the user starting to advocate for a particular approach

Remember the convergence posture loaded in Step 2 — both topic splitting and per-topic completion are possibilities. Be aware of both as you research.

**Topic awareness**: When working in a specific topic file and content drifts to another topic's scope, flag it and offer to switch to that topic's file or note it for later. Don't silently let content accumulate in the wrong file.

When you notice convergence, **flag it and give the user options**:

This thread seems to be converging — we've explored {topic} enough that the tradeoffs are clear and it's approaching decision territory.

→ Load **[convergence-awareness.md](convergence-awareness.md)** and follow its instructions.

After convergence handling (if the user chooses to keep digging), resume the session loop above.

#### If work_type is `feature`

## Research Complete

Feature research has no convergence monitoring or topic splitting. When the topic feels well-explored or the user indicates they're done:

1. Set research status to completed:
   ```bash
   node .claude/skills/workflow-manifest/scripts/manifest.js set {work_unit} --phase research --topic {topic} status completed
   ```
2. Invoke the `/workflow-bridge` skill:
   ```
   Pipeline bridge for: {work_unit}
   Completed phase: research

   Invoke the workflow-bridge skill to enter plan mode with continuation instructions.
   ```

**STOP.** Do not proceed — terminal condition.
