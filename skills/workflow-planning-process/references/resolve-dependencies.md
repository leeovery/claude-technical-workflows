All phases and tasks are written. Now I'll check for external
dependencies — things this plan needs from other topics or systems.
```

Handle external dependencies — things this plan needs from other topics or systems.

Dependencies are stored in the **manifest** as `external_dependencies` (under `planning.{topic}`). See [dependencies.md](dependencies.md) for the format and states.

#### If the specification has a Dependencies section

→ Proceed to **A. Read Existing State**.

#### If the specification has no Dependencies section

This topic has no external dependencies. Other topics may still have unresolved dependencies pointing at this plan's tasks.

→ Proceed to **E. Reverse Check**.

---

## A. Read Existing State

Check for existing `external_dependencies` in the manifest:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-manifest/scripts/manifest.js exists {work_unit}.planning.{topic} external_dependencies
```

**If `true`:**

Read the current values and note which topics have `state: satisfied_externally` — these must be preserved.

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-manifest/scripts/manifest.js get {work_unit}.planning.{topic} external_dependencies
```

**If `false`:**

No existing entries to preserve.

→ Proceed to **B. Write Spec Dependencies**.

---

## B. Write Spec Dependencies

Read the specification's Dependencies section. For each dependency in the specification, write it to the manifest.

**If an existing entry for this topic has `state: satisfied_externally`:**

Preserve the existing state — only update the description:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-manifest/scripts/manifest.js set {work_unit}.planning.{topic} external_dependencies.{dep_topic}.description "{description}"
```

**Otherwise:**

Set as unresolved:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-manifest/scripts/manifest.js set {work_unit}.planning.{topic} external_dependencies.{dep_topic}.description "{description}"
node .claude/skills/workflow-manifest/scripts/manifest.js set {work_unit}.planning.{topic} external_dependencies.{dep_topic}.state unresolved
```

→ Proceed to **C. Remove Stale Entries**.

---

## C. Remove Stale Entries

Compare the manifest's dependency topics against the specification's Dependencies section. For each manifest dependency topic that does not appear in the specification, delete it:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-manifest/scripts/manifest.js delete {work_unit}.planning.{topic} external_dependencies.{dep_topic}
```

The spec is the source of truth — stale entries from a previous planning session must be cleaned up.

#### If no stale entries exist

Nothing to remove.

→ Proceed to **D. Resolve Current Plan's Dependencies**.

#### If stale entries were removed

→ Proceed to **D. Resolve Current Plan's Dependencies**.

---

## D. Resolve Current Plan's Dependencies

For each unresolved dependency, check if a plan exists for that topic:

1. Check if `.workflows/{work_unit}/planning/{dep_topic}/planning.md` exists.
2. If yes: read the plan's task table, match a task by name against the dependency description.
3. If a match is found: update the dependency:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-manifest/scripts/manifest.js set {work_unit}.planning.{topic} external_dependencies.{dep_topic}.state resolved
node .claude/skills/workflow-manifest/scripts/manifest.js set {work_unit}.planning.{topic} external_dependencies.{dep_topic}.internal_id {matched_id}
```

4. If ambiguous (multiple potential matches): ask the user which task satisfies the dependency.
5. If no plan exists for that topic: leave the dependency as `state: unresolved`.

→ Proceed to **E. Reverse Check**.

---

## E. Reverse Check

For each other topic with a planning phase in the same work unit:

1. Check if they have external dependencies:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-manifest/scripts/manifest.js exists {work_unit}.planning.{other_topic} external_dependencies
```

**If `false`:**

Skip this topic.

**If `true`:**

Read them:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-manifest/scripts/manifest.js get {work_unit}.planning.{other_topic} external_dependencies
```

2. **Unresolved deps matching current topic** — find the satisfying task in the current plan, resolve:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-manifest/scripts/manifest.js set {work_unit}.planning.{other_topic} external_dependencies.{topic}.state resolved
node .claude/skills/workflow-manifest/scripts/manifest.js set {work_unit}.planning.{other_topic} external_dependencies.{topic}.internal_id {matched_id}
```

3. **Resolved deps pointing at current plan's tasks** — validate that the `internal_id` still refers to a task that semantically matches the dependency description. If the task name no longer matches (stale reference): re-resolve by finding the correct task. If ambiguous: ask the user.

4. **`satisfied_externally` deps** — skip.

→ Proceed to **F. Summary and Commit**.

---

## F. Summary and Commit

Present a summary of the dependency state: what was documented, what was resolved, what remains unresolved, and any reverse resolutions made.

#### If no changes were made (no deps to write, no reverse resolutions)

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
No external dependencies for this topic. No reverse resolutions needed.
```

→ Return to **[the skill](../SKILL.md)**.

#### If changes were made

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

Approve the dependency resolution?

- **`y`/`yes`** — Proceed
- **Tell me what to change** — Adjust resolutions or add missing links
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

**If the user provides feedback:**

Incorporate feedback, re-present the updated dependency state, and ask again. Repeat until approved.

**If approved:**

Commit: `planning({work_unit}): resolve external dependencies`
