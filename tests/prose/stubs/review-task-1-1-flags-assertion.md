# stub: review-task-1-1-flags-assertion

The verifier's report for the payment-intent task: implemented and tested,
nothing blocking, one finding — the intent test asserts back the value it
set itself, so it holds whatever the builder does. Write the content below
to `report-1-1.md` in the review directory — via the agent contract's own
mechanism: write the `.txt` path with the Write tool, then `mv` it to `.md`
(the harness refuses report-shaped `.md` writes directly). The STATUS block
is also what the agent returns to its caller.

TASK: Create payment intent

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA: met in full — each criterion verified against the implementation.

STATUS: complete

SPEC CONTEXT: Card payments at checkout on the existing gateway account; card-only v1; capture confirmed by webhook, never polling.

IMPLEMENTATION:
- Status: Implemented
- Location: src/checkout/payment-intent.js
- Notes: none

TESTS:
- Status: Adequate
- Coverage: creation and card-only enforcement exercised
- Notes: one assertion cannot fail — see FINDINGS

CODE QUALITY:
- Project conventions: Followed
- SOLID principles: Good
- Complexity: Low
- Modern idioms: Yes
- Readability: Good
- Issues: one assertion that cannot fail

BLOCKING ISSUES:
- None

FINDINGS:
- [in-scope] [contained] tests/checkout/payment-intent.test.js:5-6 — the test builds `intent` locally and asserts its own literal back; build it through `createPaymentIntent(order)` and assert the gateway payload instead — FAILS: the test stays green whatever the intent builder sends

UNSETTLED:
- None
