# stub: review-task-verified

A task verifier's report for one task, everything in order: implemented
where the plan says, adequately tested, no blocking issues, nothing
wrong to report.
Write the content below to the report file for the dispatched task's
suffix (`report-{phase_id}-{task_id}.md` in the review directory), with
the TASK line filled from that task — via the agent contract's own
mechanism: write the `.txt` path with the Write tool, then `mv` it to
`.md` (the harness refuses report-shaped `.md` writes directly). The
STATUS block is also what the agent returns to its caller.
