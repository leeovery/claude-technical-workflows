# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Claude Code skills package for structured technical discussion and planning workflows. Installed via `npx agntc add leeovery/claude-technical-workflows`.

## Work Types

The workflow system supports three work types, each with its own pipeline:

**Epic**: Multi-topic work spanning multiple sessions (new products, large initiatives)
- Phase-centric, multi-session, long-running (days/weeks/months)
- Topics move independently within phases
- Research → Discussion → Specification → Planning → Implementation → Review

**Feature**: Adding functionality to an existing product
- Topic-centric, single-session, linear pipeline
- Optional research step if uncertainties exist
- Discussion → Specification → Planning → Implementation → Review

**Bugfix**: Fixing broken behavior
- Investigation-centric, single-session
- Investigation replaces discussion (combines symptom gathering + code analysis)
- Investigation → Specification → Planning → Implementation → Review

## Workflow Phases

1. **Research** (`workflow-research-process` skill): EXPLORE - feasibility, market, viability, early ideas
2. **Discussion** (`workflow-discussion-process` skill): Capture WHAT and WHY - decisions, architecture, edge cases, debates
3. **Investigation** (`workflow-investigation-process` skill): Bugfix-specific - symptom gathering + code analysis → root cause
4. **Specification** (`workflow-specification-process` skill): Validate and refine into standalone spec
5. **Planning** (`workflow-planning-process` skill): Define HOW - phases, tasks, acceptance criteria
6. **Implementation** (`workflow-implementation-process` skill): Execute plan via strict TDD
7. **Review** (`workflow-review-process` skill): Validate work against discussion, specification, and plan

## Skill Architecture

Skills are organised in two tiers:

**Entry-point skills** (`/start-*`, `/continue-*`, `/status`, `/migrate`, etc.) are user-invocable. They gather context from files, prompts, or inline input, then invoke a processing skill. Utility entry-points (`/status`, `/view-plan`, `/link-dependencies`, `/workflow-start`) have `disable-model-invocation: true`. `/migrate` has `user-invocable: false` — it is model-invoked only (Step 0 of every user-invocable entry-point skill).

**Phase entry skills** (`workflow-*-entry`) are internal (`user-invocable: false`). They are invoked by start/continue/bridge skills with work_type and work_unit always provided. They handle phase-specific validation, bootstrap questions for new entries, and processing skill invocation.

**Processing skills** (`workflow-*-process`) are model-invocable. They assume pipeline context — work_type is set, prior phases are complete, artifacts are in expected locations. Phase entry skills provide all required inputs before invoking them.

### Phase Entry Skill Routing

Phase entry skills (`workflow-*-entry`) receive positional arguments: `$0` = work_type, `$1` = work_unit, `$2` = topic (optional). Topic resolution: `topic = $2 || (wt !== 'epic' ? $1 : null)`.

**With topic** (feature/bugfix always; epic when caller provides it):
- Check manifest phase status → new entry (bootstrap questions) / resume / reopen
- No discovery needed — topic is already determined

**Without topic** (epic only — scoped path):
- Run discovery scoped to work_unit → analysis/selection flow → determine topic
- Only used by discussion and specification (research also, but simpler — just asks seed questions)
- Planning, implementation, review always receive a topic

## Key Conventions

**Work types and work units**: A *work type* is one of three pipeline shapes: epic, feature, or bugfix. A *work unit* is a named instance of a work type (e.g., "auth-flow" is a feature work unit, "payments-overhaul" is an epic work unit). Each work unit gets its own directory under `.workflows/` and its own `manifest.json`.

**Topics**: A *topic* is the item within a phase. For feature/bugfix, the topic name equals the work unit name (single topic moving through the pipeline). For epic, topics are distinct from the work unit name (multiple topics per phase). All work types use per-topic items in the manifest (unified structure). The discussion phase analyses all research files collectively to derive discussion topics.

Work-unit-first directory structure with uniform `{topic}` in all paths. For feature/bugfix, `{topic}` equals `{work_unit}`. For epic, `{topic}` is the item within a phase.

- Manifest: `.workflows/{work_unit}/manifest.json`
- Research: `.workflows/{work_unit}/research/`
- Discussion: `.workflows/{work_unit}/discussion/{topic}.md` (flat file)
- Investigation: `.workflows/{work_unit}/investigation/{topic}.md` (flat file)
- Specification: `.workflows/{work_unit}/specification/{topic}/specification.md`
- Planning: `.workflows/{work_unit}/planning/{topic}/planning.md` + `tasks/`
- Implementation: `.workflows/{work_unit}/implementation/{topic}/implementation.md`
- Review: `.workflows/{work_unit}/review/{topic}/report.md`
- State: `.workflows/{work_unit}/.state/` (per-work-unit analysis files)
- Global state: `.workflows/.state/` (migrations, environment-setup.md)
- Cache: `.workflows/.cache/` (planning scratch)

**work_type field**: Each work unit's `work_type` (epic, feature, or bugfix) is stored in its `manifest.json` — the single source of truth for all workflow state. This enables:
- Unified discovery across all phases
- Correct pipeline routing via workflow-bridge
- Work-type-specific behavior in processing skills

**Work unit lifecycle**: Each work unit has a `status` field in its manifest tracking its lifecycle state:
- `in-progress` — actively being worked on (default on creation)
- `completed` — pipeline finished (set automatically when the pipeline completes, or manually via the manage menu)
- `cancelled` — abandoned (set manually via the manage menu)

Discovery scripts filter by status — `workflow-start` and `continue-*` show active work by default, with menu options to view completed/cancelled items or manage lifecycle state. Completed/cancelled work units can be reactivated.

**Feature-to-epic pivot**: Features can be converted to epics via the manage menu (`p`/`pivot`). After pivot, the user can continue immediately as an epic or return to the previous view.

**Epic soft gates**: When navigating forward between phases in an epic (via `continue-epic`), advisory gates warn if prerequisite phase items are still in-progress. These are informational, not blocking — the user can proceed anyway. Covers research→discussion, discussion→specification, specification→planning, and planning→implementation transitions. The system recovers gracefully via re-analysis if the user proceeds early.

Commit docs frequently (natural breaks, before context refresh). Skills capture context, don't implement.

## Adding New Output Formats

Use the `/create-output-format` skill to scaffold a new format adapter. Each format is a directory of 5 files:

```
skills/workflow-planning-process/references/output-formats/{format}/
├── about.md        # Benefits, setup, output location
├── authoring.md    # Task storage, flagging, cleanup
├── reading.md      # Extracting tasks, next available task
├── updating.md     # Marking complete/skipped
└── graph.md        # Task graph — priority + dependencies
```

The contract and scaffolding templates live in `.claude/skills/create-output-format/references/`.

## Output Format References (IMPORTANT)

**NEVER list output format names (linear, local-markdown, etc.) anywhere except:**
- `skills/workflow-planning-process/references/output-formats.md` - the authoritative list
- `skills/workflow-planning-process/references/output-formats/{format}/` - individual format directories
- `README.md` - user-facing documentation where format options are presented

**Why this matters:** Listing formats elsewhere creates maintenance dependencies. If a format is added or removed, we should only need to update the planning references - not hunt through other skills or documentation.

**How other phases reference formats:**
- Plans include a `format` field in their manifest
- Consumers load only the per-concern file they need (e.g., `{format}/reading.md` for implementation)

This keeps format knowledge centralized in the planning phase where it belongs.

## Migrations

The `/migrate` skill keeps workflow files in sync with the current system design. It runs via Step 0 at the start of every entry-point skill.

**How it works:**
- `skills/migrate/scripts/migrate.sh` runs all migration scripts in `skills/migrate/scripts/migrations/` in numeric order
- Each migration is idempotent - safe to run multiple times
- Progress is tracked in `.workflows/.state/migrations`
- Delete the log file to force re-running all migrations

**Adding new migrations:**
1. Create `skills/migrate/scripts/migrations/NNN-description.sh` (e.g., `002-spec-frontmatter.sh`)
2. The script will be run automatically in numeric order
3. The orchestrator handles tracking — once a migration ID appears in the log, the script never runs again
4. Use helper functions: `report_update`, `report_skip` (for display only)

**Migration 016 — Work-unit restructure:**
Migration 016 converts phase-first directories to work-unit-first, creates `manifest.json` files from artifact frontmatter, renames `plan.md` to `planning.md` and `tracking.md` to `implementation.md`, and updates `work_type: greenfield` to `epic`. Frontmatter is preserved in migrated artifacts as a safety net — a follow-up migration will strip it once the manifest system is proven.

**Migration 025 — Unified manifest items:**
Migration 025 ensures all work types use the `phases.<phase>.items.<topic>` layout. For feature/bugfix manifests with legacy flat phase data, it wraps fields into `items[manifest.name]`. Phase-level keys (`analysis_cache`) stay at phase level. Epics are unaffected.

**Critical: Frontmatter extraction in bash scripts**

Workflow documents may contain `---` horizontal rules in body content. NEVER use `sed -n '/^---$/,/^---$/p'` to extract frontmatter — it matches ALL `---` pairs, not just the first frontmatter block, causing body content to leak into extraction results and potential content loss during file rewrites.

Always use this awk pattern for safe frontmatter extraction:
```bash
awk 'BEGIN{c=0} /^---$/{c++; if(c==2) exit; next} c==1{print}' "$file"
```

For content after frontmatter (preserving all body `---`):
```bash
awk '/^---$/ && c<2 {c++; next} c>=2 {print}' "$file"
```

Also avoid BSD sed incompatibilities: `sed '/range/{cmd1;cmd2}'` syntax fails on macOS. Use awk or separate `sed -e` expressions instead.

**Critical: Migration scripts must not use the manifest CLI**

Migration scripts are point-in-time snapshots. The manifest CLI validates values against the current schema, which changes over time (e.g., valid statuses). A migration that uses the CLI today may break silently when validation rules change in a later release. Always read and write `manifest.json` directly using `node` (or `jq`) — never via the manifest CLI. This ensures migrations remain stable regardless of future schema changes.

## Manifest CLI

The manifest CLI at `skills/workflow-manifest/scripts/manifest.js` is the single source of truth for all workflow state. It replaces YAML frontmatter for state management — artifacts are pure markdown with no frontmatter.

Key properties:
- JSON format, zero dependencies (Node handles JSON natively)
- Domain-aware flag syntax: `--phase` and `--topic` flags route to correct internal path based on work_type
- Skills never know manifest internal structure — all work types use items
- File locking for concurrent session safety
- Validation of structural values (work_type, phase names, statuses, gate modes)
- Manifest location: `.workflows/{work_unit}/manifest.json`

Domain-aware CLI grammar:
```bash
MANIFEST="node .claude/skills/workflow-manifest/scripts/manifest.js"
$MANIFEST get {work_unit} --phase discussion --topic {topic} status    # phase-level read
$MANIFEST set {work_unit} --phase discussion --topic {topic} status completed  # phase-level write
$MANIFEST init-phase {work_unit} --phase discussion --topic {topic}    # create phase entry
$MANIFEST push {work_unit} --phase implementation --topic {topic} completed_tasks "{topic}-1-1"  # append to array (internal ID)
$MANIFEST exists {work_unit}                                           # existence check (exits 0, outputs true/false)
$MANIFEST list                                                         # enumerate all work units
$MANIFEST get {work_unit} work_type                                    # work-unit-level read
$MANIFEST set {work_unit} status completed                             # work-unit-level status
$MANIFEST set {work_unit} phases.research.analysis_cache '{"checksum":"..."}' # work-unit-level write (dot-path)
$MANIFEST delete {work_unit} phases.research.analysis_cache             # delete a key (work-unit-level)
$MANIFEST get {work_unit} --phase discussion --topic "*" status        # wildcard: collect from all topics
```

**Wildcard topic**: `--topic "*"` collects values from all topics in a phase. Works with `get` and `exists` commands. Iterates all items for any work type. For feature/bugfix: returns the single item (topic matches work unit name).

See `skills/workflow-manifest/SKILL.md` for the full API.

## Display & Output Conventions (IMPORTANT)

All entry-point skills that present discovery state, menus, or interactive choices MUST follow these conventions. This ensures a consistent, scannable experience across all phases.

### Rendering Instructions

Every **user-facing output** fenced block in skill files must be preceded by a rendering instruction. Fenced blocks that are model instructions (bash commands to execute, file paths to load) are exempt — they are not displayed to the user.

```
> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*
```

or:

```
> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*
```

Code blocks are used for informational displays (overviews, status, keys) — they preserve indentation for tree structures and aligned lists. Markdown is used for interactive elements (menus, prompts) where bold formatting is needed. When content benefits from rendered formatting (headings, checkboxes, bold) and indentation control isn't needed, prefer markdown rendering even for informational displays.

### Title Pattern

Always `{Phase} Overview` as the first line of the opening code block, followed by a blank line and a summary sentence.

```
Planning Overview

4 specifications found. 2 plans exist.
```

### Template Placeholders

Skill files use placeholders in fenced block templates. The syntax is:

```
{name}                                    — raw value, output as-is
{name:[option1|option2|option3]}          — enumerated options (pick one)
{name:(casing)}                           — with casing hint
{name:[option1|option2]:(casing)}         — options and casing
```

Casing hints: `titlecase`, `lowercase`, `kebabcase`. No hint means output the raw value.

Each part is optional — use only what's needed for clarity.

**Conditional directives** for branches that render differently based on state:

```
@if(condition) truthy content @else falsy content @endif
```

Example: `@if(has_discussion) {topic}.md ({status:[in-progress|completed]}) @else (no discussion) @endif`

**Loop directives** for iterating over collections:

```
@foreach(item in collection)
  • {item.name} ({item.status})
@endforeach
```

Example with filter: `@foreach(inv in investigations.files where status is in-progress)`

**When to use placeholders vs concrete examples:** Placeholders work well for structural templates (tree displays, status blocks) where each field has a clear source. Selection menus should use concrete examples instead — they encode conditional logic (which verb maps to which state) that placeholders obscure.

### Tree Structure

Every actionable item gets a numbered entry with `└─` branches showing its state. Depth varies by phase but structure is consistent. **Blank line between each numbered item.** Show one full entry, then `2. ...` to indicate repetition.

```
1. {topic:(titlecase)}
   └─ Plan: @if(has_plan) {plan_status:[in-progress|completed]} @else (no plan) @endif
   └─ Spec: {spec_status:[in-progress|completed]}

2. ...
```

For richer hierarchies (specification phase):

```
1. {topic:(titlecase)}
   └─ Spec: {spec_status:[in-progress|completed]} ({extraction_summary})
   └─ Discussions:
      ├─ {discussion} ({status:[extracted|pending]})
      └─ ...
```

### Status Terms

Always parenthetical `(term)`. Never brackets or dash-separated.

Core vocabulary: `in-progress`, `completed`, `ready`, `extracted`, `pending`, `reopened`. Phase-specific terms are fine but format is always `(term)`.

### Cross-Plan References

Use colon notation to reference a task within a plan: `{plan}:{internal_id}`.

```
  · advanced-features (blocked by core-features:core-2-3)
```

Reads as: "advanced-features is blocked by task core-2-3 in the core-features plan."

### "Not Ready" Blocks

Separate code block. Descriptive heading as `{Artifacts} not ready for {phase}:`, explanatory line, then `•` bullets with parenthetical status. **Blank line after the explanation, before the list.**

```
Specifications not ready for planning:
These specifications are either still in progress or cross-cutting
and cannot be planned directly.

  • caching-strategy (cross-cutting, completed)
  • rate-limiting (cross-cutting, in-progress)
```

### Key / Legend

Separate code block. Categorized. Em dash (`—`) separators. **No `---` separator before the Key block.** Only show statuses that appear in the current display. **Blank line between categories.**

```
Key:

  Plan status:
    in-progress — planning work is ongoing
    completed   — plan is done

  Spec type:
    cross-cutting — architectural policy, not directly plannable
    feature       — plannable feature specification
```

### Menus / Interactive Prompts

Rendered as markdown (not code blocks). Framed with `· · · · · · · · · · · ·` dot separators at top and bottom — no blank lines between the dots and the content they frame. A question or contextual label appears first inside the dots, followed by a blank line, then the options. Verb-based labels for selection menus. No single-character icons.

**Option types** — menus contain two kinds of option:

- **Command option** (explicit): A discrete input the user types verbatim. Formatted with backtick-wrapped shorthand: **`y`/`yes`**, **`s`/`single`**, **`a`/`auto`**. The shorthand is the first letter of the word; if two options in the same menu share a first letter, use the second letter for the conflicting option (e.g., **`a`/`approve`** and **`b`/`abort`**). The conditional branch uses the command value (e.g., `#### If \`yes\``).
- **Prompt option** (implicit): The user responds naturally rather than issuing a command. Formatted with plain bold text (no backticks): **Keep going**, **Comment**, **Ask**. The conditional branch uses the label in lowercase (e.g., `#### If keep going`). Limit to one prompt option per menu to avoid ambiguity — since routing is intent-based, multiple prompt options would be hard to distinguish.

Both types use `— description` to explain what the option does (unless self-evident, as with yes/no).

**Mixed prompt** — command and prompt options together:

```
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
Investigation complete. Ready to conclude?

- **`y`/`yes`** — Conclude investigation
- **Keep going** — Continue discussing to explore further
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
```

**Selection menu** — use concrete examples showing verb-to-state mapping:

```
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
1. Create "Auth Flow" — completed spec, no plan
2. Continue "Data Model" — plan in-progress
3. Review "Billing" — plan completed

Select an option (enter number):
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
```

**Yes/no prompt:**

```
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
Proceed?
- **`y`/`yes`**
- **`n`/`no`**
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
```

**Multi-choice prompt:**

```
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
What scope would you like to review?

- **`s`/`single`** — Review one plan's implementation
- **`m`/`multi`** — Review selected plans
- **`a`/`all`** — Review all implemented plans
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
```

**Meta options** in selection menus get backtick-wrapped descriptions:

```
3. Unify all into single specification
   `All discussions combined into one specification.`
   `Existing specifications are incorporated and superseded.`
```

### Auto-Select

When only one actionable item exists:

```
Automatically proceeding with "{topic:(titlecase)}".
```

### Block / Terminal Messages

When a phase can't proceed — use the phase title pattern, then explain:

```
Planning Overview

No specification found in .workflows/{work_unit}/specification/{topic}/

The planning phase requires a completed specification.
```

### Bullet Characters

Use `•` for all bulleted lists (sources, files, not-ready items, etc.).

### Spacing Rules

Inside code blocks, maintain **one blank line** between:
- Title/summary and first content
- Each numbered tree item
- Section headings and their content
- Key categories

Between code blocks (overview → not-ready → key → menu), no `---` separators — just the natural block separation.

## Structural Conventions (IMPORTANT)

All skill files (entry-point and processing) MUST follow these structural conventions for consistency.

### Stop Gates

Use `**STOP.**` (bold, period). This is the only pattern for user interaction boundaries.

Two categories:

**Interaction stop** — waiting for real user input to continue:
```
**STOP.** Wait for user response.
**STOP.** Wait for user response before proceeding.
```

**Terminal stop** — skill is done, nothing to process:
```
**STOP.** Do not proceed — terminal condition.
```

Never use `Stop here.`, `Command ends.`, `Wait for user to acknowledge before ending.`, or other variations.

### Heading Hierarchy

- **H1** (`#`): File title only — one per file, at the top
- **H2** (`##`): Steps and major sections (`## Step N: {Name}`, `## Notes`, `## Instructions`)
- **H3** (`###`): Subsections within steps (`### 6a: Warn about in-progress specs`)
- **H4** (`####`): Conditional routing only (`#### If {condition}`, `#### Otherwise`)

### Step Numbering

Sequential: `## Step 0`, `## Step 1`, `## Step 2`, etc.

- **Step 0** runs migrations via the `/migrate` skill (mandatory in all entry-point skills)
- Steps are separated by `---` horizontal rules
- Each step completes fully before the next begins

### Conditional Routing

Use H4 headings for if/else branches within a step:

```
#### If scenario is "no_specs"
{content}

#### If scenario is "has_options"
{content}
```

**Nested conditionals** — use bold text for conditionals inside an H4 block:

```
#### If yes

1. Shared setup steps...

**If work_type is set** (feature, bugfix, or epic):

{branch content}

**If work_type is not set:**

{branch content}
```

**Avoid double-nesting** — if a bold conditional would contain further bold conditionals, flatten by combining conditions:

```
**If work_type is not set and other discussions exist:**
...
**If work_type is not set and no discussions remain:**
...
```

Rules:
- Never use else-if chains — each condition gets its own `#### If` heading
- Lowercase after "If" (e.g., `#### If completed_count == 1`)
- Use `#### Otherwise` for else branches
- Use backticks around specific values, variables, and statuses in H4 headings (e.g., `` #### If `STATUS` is `clean` ``, `` #### If work type is `feature` ``). Natural language conditions stay plain text (e.g., `#### If no plan provided`)
- Use "and" between conditions, not commas
- Drop implied conditions (e.g., if Step 2 already gates on `completed_count >= 1`, Step 3 doesn't need to repeat it on every branch)
- H4 for top-level conditionals, bold text for nested — never use H5/H6 for conditional nesting
- If double-nesting would occur, flatten by combining the parent and child conditions into a single bold conditional

### Navigation Arrows

Use `→` for flow control between steps or to external files:

```
→ Proceed to **Step 4**.
→ Proceed to **Step 7** to invoke the skill.
→ Load **[file.md](file.md)** and follow its instructions.
```

### Reference File Headers

Reference files loaded by skills use this header pattern:

```
# Title

*Reference for **[parent-skill](../SKILL.md)***

---
```

### Critical / Important Markers

Use bold labels with colons for emphasis levels:

```
**CRITICAL**: This guidance is mandatory.
**IMPORTANT**: Use ONLY this script for discovery.
**CHECKPOINT**: Summarize progress before continuing.
```

### Zero Output Rule

Entry-point skills that invoke processing skills use this exact blockquote to prevent narration:

```
> **⚠️ ZERO OUTPUT RULE**: Do not narrate your processing. Produce no output until a step or reference file explicitly specifies display content. No "proceeding with...", no discovery summaries, no routing decisions, no transition text. Your first output must be content explicitly called for by the instructions.
```

### Auto-Mode Gates

Per-item approval gates can offer `a`/`auto` to let the user bypass repeated STOP gates. This pattern is used in implementation (task + fix gates), planning (task list approval + task authoring + review findings), and specification (review findings).

**Manifest tracking**: Gate modes are stored in the manifest via CLI (`gated` or `auto`). This ensures they survive context refresh.

**Behavior when `auto`**: Content is always rendered above the gate check (so both modes see identical output). Auto mode proceeds without a STOP gate. Use a rendering instruction + code block for the one-line announcement:

```
> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

\```
Task {M} of {total}: {Task Name} — authored. Logging to plan.
\```
```

**Lifecycle**:
- Default: `gated` (set in manifest on creation)
- Opt-in: user chooses `a`/`auto` at any per-item gate → manifest updated via CLI before next commit
- Reset: entry-point skills reset gates to `gated` on fresh invocation (not on `continue`)
- Context refresh: read gate modes from manifest and preserve

**Menu option format**: Add between the primary action and secondary options:
```
- **`a`/`auto`** — Approve this and all remaining {items} automatically
```

**Re-loop safety cap**: When auto-mode enables automatic re-analysis loops, cap at 5 cycles before escalating to the user. This prevents infinite cascading.

### Rendering Instructions for Ask Blocks

When a step asks the user a question, wrap it in a rendering instruction and code block — don't use bare `Ask:` labels:

```
> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

\```
What's on your mind?

- What idea or topic do you want to explore?
- What prompted this - a problem, opportunity, curiosity?
\```

**STOP.** Wait for user response before proceeding.
```

## Skill File Structure (Progressive Disclosure)

All skills (entry-point and processing) use a backbone + reference file pattern. The backbone (SKILL.md) is always loaded and reads like a table of contents. Reference files contain step detail, loaded on demand via Load directives.

### Backbone Structure

```
Frontmatter
One-liner purpose statement
Workflow context table
"Stay in your lane" instruction
---
Critical instructions (STOP/wait rules, mandatory guidance)
---
Step 0: Run Migrations (always inline)
---
Step 1: {Name}
Load directive → reference file
→ Proceed to Step 2.
---
Step 2: {Name}
Load directive → reference file
```

**Stays inline:** Migrations (Step 0), simple routing conditionals (a few lines), frontmatter and critical instructions.

**Gets extracted:** User interaction sequences, display/output formatting, handoff templates, discovery parsing, analysis logic, routing logic with significant conditional content.

### Load Directive Format

```markdown
## Step N: {Step Name}

Load **[name.md](references/name.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ Proceed to **Step N+1**.
```

Rules:
- No arrow (`→`) before the Load line — it's the step's content, not a routing instruction
- Bold the markdown link: `**[name.md](path)**`
- `→ Proceed to` appears after the Load directive, separated by a blank line
- The final step has no `→ Proceed to` (it's terminal)
- Within reference files routing to other reference files, use `→` before Load (it IS a routing instruction in that context)

### Reference File Structure

```markdown
# {Step Name}

*Reference for **[skill-name](../SKILL.md)***

---

{content}
```

- Header matches the step concept, not the filename
- Italic attribution line links back to the parent SKILL.md
- Horizontal rule separates header from content

### Navigation & Return Patterns

The same navigation conventions apply across all skill tiers (entry-point and processing).

**Forward navigation** — moving to the next step or phase:
```
→ Proceed to **Step N**.
→ Proceed to **B. Phase Name**.
```

**Return navigation** — returning to the parent skill or a previous phase:
```
→ Return to **[the skill](../SKILL.md)** for **Step N**.
→ Return to **[the skill](../SKILL.md)**.
→ Return to **[plan-review.md](plan-review.md)** for the next phase.
→ Return to **A. Phase Name**.
```

Rules:
- Only two routing verbs: `→ Proceed to` (forward) and `→ Return to` (backward/upward)
- No adverbs — `→ Proceed to`, never `→ Proceed directly to`
- No alternative verbs — never `→ Go to`, `→ Jump to`, `→ Skip to`, `→ Continue to`, `→ Enter`
- Use links when routing to another file (parent SKILL.md or calling reference file)
- No links for internal routing within the same file (lettered phases, named sections)
- When skipping steps, use a parenthetical: `→ Proceed to **Step 5** (skipping Steps 1–3).`
- Single-exit reference files end with `→ Return to **[the skill](../SKILL.md)**.` — the backbone's `→ Proceed to **Step N**.` handles onward sequencing
- Multi-exit reference files end each path with `→ Return to **[the skill](../SKILL.md)** for **Step N**.`
- Terminal reference files (invoke-skill.md, phase-bridge.md) invoke a processing skill as their final action — no return needed

### Internal Reference File Phases

Complex reference files with multiple sequential phases use lettered headings to avoid collision with backbone step numbers:

```markdown
## A. First Phase

...
→ Proceed to **B. Second Phase**.

## B. Second Phase

...
→ Proceed to **C. Third Phase**.
```

Simple reference files use named sections (`## Seed Idea`, `## Current Knowledge`) without letters.

### Reference File Naming

| Name | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `gather-context.md` | User interview / context gathering questions |
| `invoke-skill.md` | Handoff to processing skill |
| `route-scenario.md` | Scenario routing (for skills with branching) |
| `validate-{thing}.md` | Pre-flight validation (plan exists, spec completed, etc.) |
| `display-{variant}.md` | Display outputs (for skills with multiple displays) |
| `analysis-flow.md` | Multi-step analysis logic |
| `confirm-and-handoff.md` | Confirmation prompt + skill invocation combined |

Not every skill needs all of these.
