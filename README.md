## What is this?

A structured development workflow for Claude Code that turns conversations into working software. Instead of jumping straight to code, you discuss the *what* and *why* first — then the system builds specifications, plans implementation, writes code via strict TDD, and validates the result.

**What you get:**

- **Decisions that stick.** Architecture choices, edge cases, and trade-offs are captured in discussion documents — not lost to chat history. When you come back in a week, the context is there.
- **Specifications that catch mistakes early.** The system analyses your discussions, filters hallucinations, fills gaps, and produces a validated spec before any code is written.
- **Plans with real structure.** Specifications become phased implementation plans with tasks, acceptance criteria, and dependency ordering. Choose where tasks live — [local markdown files, Linear issues, or Tick CLI](#output-formats).
- **Implementation via strict TDD.** Tests first, then code, commit after each task. Per-task approval gates keep you in control, or switch to auto-mode when you trust the flow.
- **Validation at every stage.** Specifications are reviewed against source material and analysed for gaps. Plans are checked for spec traceability and structural integrity. Implementation is analysed for architecture conformance, duplication, and coding standards. Review verifies against spec and plan. Findings become remediation tasks automatically.
- **Context that survives.** Each phase clears the context window and starts fresh, so you're never fighting token limits on large work. State lives in a manifest, not in conversation history.
## Getting Started

### Install

```bash
npx agntc add leeovery/claude-technical-workflows
```

Skills are copied to `.claude/` in your project. Commit them to make them available everywhere, including Claude Code for Web.

### Requirements

- Node.js 18+

### Your First Workflow

Run `/workflow-start` — it shows all active work, lets you continue where you left off, or start something new. When in doubt, this is your entry point.

Or jump straight in:

| Command | Use when... |
|---------|-------------|
| `/start-feature` | You're adding functionality to an existing product |
| `/start-epic` | The work spans multiple topics and sessions |
| `/start-bugfix` | Something is broken and needs fixing |

Each command gathers context through a brief interview, then pipelines you through every phase automatically. Phase transitions clear context and start fresh — you approve each one.

## The Workflow

Three work types, each with its own pipeline:

```
Epic:      Research → Discussion → Specification → Planning → Implementation → Review
Feature: (Research) → Discussion → Specification → Planning → Implementation → Review
Bugfix:            Investigation → Specification → Planning → Implementation → Review
```

**Epics** are for large initiatives spanning multiple sessions. Topics move independently — 10 discussions might yield 5 specifications, each planned and implemented separately. Advisory soft gates warn when moving between phases if prerequisite items are still in progress.

**Features** are for adding functionality. Single topic, linear pipeline. Research is optional — skip it if you know what you're building. If a feature grows beyond scope, pivot it to an epic without losing progress.

**Bugfixes** replace discussion with investigation — structured symptom gathering combined with code analysis to find the root cause before specifying the fix.

### The Phases

| Phase | Purpose | Applies to |
|-------|---------|------------|
| **Research** | Explore ideas, market fit, technical feasibility. Output is analysed to derive discussion topics automatically. | Epic, Feature (opt.) |
| **Discussion** | Deep dives into architecture, edge cases, and rationale. Captures not just decisions, but *why* you made them. | Epic, Feature |
| **Investigation** | Symptom gathering + code analysis to identify root cause. The bugfix alternative to discussion. | Bugfix |
| **Specification** | Analyses all discussions/investigation, filters hallucinations, enriches gaps, validates decisions. Reviewed against source material and analysed for gaps before finalising. The spec becomes the golden document — planning references only this. | All |
| **Planning** | Converts specs into phased plans with tasks, acceptance criteria, and dependencies. Validated for spec traceability and structural integrity. Per-item approval gates with auto-mode. | All |
| **Implementation** | Strict TDD — tests first, then code, commit per task. Post-implementation analysis agents check architecture, duplication, and standards. | All |
| **Review** | Parallel subagents verify each task against spec and plan. Findings become remediation tasks that feed back into implementation. | All |

### Lifecycle

Work units are **in-progress**, **completed**, or **cancelled**. Completion happens automatically when the pipeline finishes, or manually via the manage menu in `/workflow-start`. Completed and cancelled work can be reactivated. Feature and bugfix pipelines offer early completion after implementation (skip review).

## Key Features

### 17 Specialized Agents

Complex phases spawn parallel subagents for isolated concerns — planning uses 6 agents for phase design, task authoring, dependency graphing, and quality review. Implementation uses 7 for TDD execution, post-task review, and cross-cutting analysis. Specification and review each use 2 for input validation and gap analysis.

### Output Formats

Planning supports multiple output formats through an adapter pattern. Each format implements the same contract, so the workflow works identically regardless of where tasks are stored.

| Format | Best for | Setup |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **Tick** (recommended) | AI-driven workflows, native dependency graphs, token-efficient | `brew install leeovery/tools/tick` |
| **Local Markdown** | Simple features, offline, quick iterations | None |
| **Linear** | Team collaboration, visual tracking | Linear account + MCP server |

### Auto-Mode Gates

Every approval gate (task authoring, implementation, review findings) can be switched to auto-mode. Choose `a`/`auto` at any gate to approve all remaining items automatically. Gates reset on fresh sessions for safety.

### Cross-Topic Dependencies

For epics with multiple plans, `/link-dependencies` scans for unresolved cross-topic references and wires them up.

### Workflow Dashboard

`/workflow-start` is a unified dashboard — view all active work, manage lifecycle (complete, cancel, reactivate), pivot features to epics, and route to the right skill.
