# Codebase Intelligence — Code Wiki, AST Graph & Freshness Engine

## The Idea

A multi-layered system that builds and maintains a living understanding of the host codebase. Combines an LLM-authored wiki (prose understanding), an AST-derived code graph (structural facts), git intelligence (change patterns), and a freshness engine (CI hooks + scheduled refresh) to provide rich codebase context throughout all workflow phases.

Solves the knowledge base cold-start problem: when workflows are adopted on an existing codebase, the KB is empty while the codebase is full of architectural decisions, domain concepts, conventions, and history. This system bootstraps that understanding and keeps it current.

## Why This Matters

The knowledge base (Orama, RAG, semantic search) is designed to accumulate institutional memory going forward — decisions, rationale, rejected approaches, specifications. But the majority use case is adoption on existing mature projects, not greenfield. On day one:

- **Architectural decisions** are baked into structure, module boundaries, dependency patterns — but the KB knows nothing about them
- **Domain concepts** are encoded in naming, abstractions, entity relationships — invisible to the workflow system
- **Conventions** are visible in patterns, testing approach, error handling style — but each session rediscovers them
- **Technical debt** is signalled by TODOs, workarounds, complexity hotspots — unknown to planning
- **History** lives in git log, blame, PR descriptions — disconnected from workflow context

Without codebase intelligence, the first epic/feature starts with zero context despite the project having years of embedded knowledge. Each workflow session spends significant time re-orienting to the codebase before doing actual work.

## Prior Art: Graphify

Discussed on April 6, 2026 (session `fd525e02-e07a-4f0d-af7a-7ac3dafb4e28` in the agentic-workflows project). Graphify (`github.com/safishamsi/graphify`, PyPI: `graphifyy`) is a Python-based tool that transforms codebases into queryable knowledge graphs.

Key technical details:
- Seven-stage pipeline: detect → extract → build_graph → cluster → analyze → report → export
- Two-pass extraction: tree-sitter for AST parsing (13 languages), second pass for non-code content
- Graph built with NetworkX, Leiden community detection for clustering
- Query via graph traversal (BFS/DFS from seed nodes), not vector/embedding search
- Claims 71.5x fewer tokens per query vs reading raw files (52-file mixed corpus)
- Python dependencies: tree-sitter, graspologic, networkx

Conclusion from that session: Graphify and the workflow knowledge base solve fundamentally different problems. Graphify indexes code structure (AST entities + relationships). The KB retrieves verbatim prose (decisions, rationale) via semantic search. They're complementary — Graphify could index the codebase itself while the KB indexes workflow artifacts about that codebase.

The distribution constraint matters: Graphify is Python + tree-sitter (native deps), and agentic-workflows distributes via `npx agntc add` with a zero-native-dependency requirement. Can't bundle Graphify directly, but the concept can be rebuilt using tree-sitter WASM.

## Layer 1: Code Wiki (LLM-Authored, Karpathy-Inspired)

Inspired by Karpathy's LLM Wiki concept (also discussed April 6). Not a one-shot analysis — a living, LLM-maintained knowledge document that grows richer with every workflow session.

### What the Wiki Contains

The documentation a senior dev would write for onboarding — except Claude writes it, keeps it current, and queries it for its own context.

**Module pages** — one per significant module/service. Contains: purpose, key abstractions (with semantic anchors like `AuthService.validateCredentials()`), dependencies, dependents, conventions specific to this module. Example content:

```
# AuthService

Purpose: Handles credential validation, token issuance, session management.

Key abstractions:
  - AuthService.validateCredentials() — entry point for all login flows
  - TokenService.issueToken() / .refreshToken() — JWT lifecycle
  - SessionStore — Redis-backed, TTL 24h

Dependencies:
  - UserRepository (reads user + hashed password)
  - PasswordService (bcrypt verify)
  - EventBus (emits auth.login.success / auth.login.failed)

Dependents:
  - AuthMiddleware (every protected route)
  - LoginController, OAuthController

Conventions:
  - All auth errors throw AuthError subtypes (never raw Error)
  - Token payload: { sub: userId, role, iat, exp }
```

**Flow pages** — key user journeys traced through the code. Contains: numbered step-by-step trace with file references, error paths, and notes about non-obvious behavior. Example content:

```
# Login Flow

1. POST /api/auth/login → LoginController.login()
2. → AuthService.validateCredentials(email, password)
3.   → UserRepository.findByEmail(email)
4.   → PasswordService.verify(password, user.passwordHash)
5.   → TokenService.issueToken(user)
6.   → SessionStore.create(token, user.id)
7.   → EventBus.emit('auth.login.success', { userId })
8. ← { token, refreshToken, expiresIn }

Error paths:
  - Step 3 returns null → AuthError.USER_NOT_FOUND (mapped to 401, not 404)
  - Step 4 fails → AuthError.INVALID_CREDENTIALS
  - Step 6 fails → retried 2x then AuthError.SESSION_ERROR (500)
```

**Convention pages** — patterns, testing approach, error handling, naming conventions observed across the codebase.

**Architecture index** — high-level map: API layer, service layer, data layer, events, auth, testing approach. The map of maps.

### How the Wiki Grows

1. **Bootstrap**: Initial analysis pass reads entry points, config, top-level modules, test structure. Produces rough wiki pages. This is the cold-start solution — better than nothing, not perfect.

2. **Passive enrichment**: During every workflow session, Claude reads code to do its actual work (investigating bugs, implementing features). As it discovers things — non-obvious error handling patterns, complex flows, undocumented conventions — it contributes back to the wiki.

3. **Active refresh**: When Claude opens a wiki page and notices the code has diverged (function renamed, file moved, pattern changed), it updates the wiki in-place. Staleness self-heals through use.

4. **Change-triggered**: Git diff since last analysis timestamp flags wiki pages whose source files changed, marks them as stale, re-verifies on next access.

### Storage

Wiki pages stored as markdown in `.workflows/.knowledge/wiki/`. Indexed into the KB for semantic search (they're prose artifacts, the KB already knows how to handle them). Also directly readable — Claude can load a specific module page when it needs targeted context.

## Layer 2: AST Code Graph (Structural Facts)

The wiki relies on Claude reading code and producing understanding. This works but has specific weaknesses:

- Claude samples — reads 5 callers of a function, misses 25. The AST catches all call sites exhaustively.
- Claude can hallucinate relationships ("I think X depends on Y"). The AST is ground truth — parsed, not inferred.
- Bootstrap is token-expensive on large codebases. AST parsing is milliseconds per file.
- Refreshing stale wiki pages means re-reading files with Claude. Re-parsing a changed file via AST is instant.
- "What calls X?" requires grep + interpretation. Graph traversal is instant and complete.

The relationship between layers: **AST = skeleton, Wiki = meaning**. The graph provides structural facts (entities, relationships, call sites, import chains, type signatures). The wiki provides interpreted understanding (purpose, conventions, design intent, domain concepts). Neither alone is sufficient — AST can't explain why, Claude can't guarantee completeness.

### How the Graph Feeds the Wiki

During bootstrap:
1. AST parses every source file → entity + relationship graph
2. Graph analysis identifies modules, boundaries, high-fanout nodes (key abstractions), clusters (related code)
3. Claude receives graph summary for each module cluster → writes wiki pages grounded in structural fact
4. Result: wiki pages that are exhaustive (nothing missed) and interpreted (meaning explained)

During ongoing use:
1. File changes → re-parse → graph diff
2. Graph diff tells exactly what changed: "new dependency from PaymentService → AuthService" or "RateLimitMiddleware added to middleware chain"
3. Flag affected wiki pages as stale with specific change context
4. Next session, Claude refreshes the stale page using the graph diff rather than re-reading the whole file

The graph makes wiki maintenance surgical instead of wholesale.

### Distribution Feasibility

Zero-native-dep constraint is solvable via tree-sitter WASM:

- `web-tree-sitter` has official WASM builds — runs in Node without native compilation
- Language grammars are WASM files (~200KB-1MB each)
- Not bundled into `knowledge.cjs` — stored as sibling files, loaded at runtime
- Common grammars (JS/TS, Python, Go, Rust, Java, PHP, Ruby) ≈ 5-8MB total
- Alternative: download grammars on-demand and cache them

Graph itself is plain JSON (entities + edges). No NetworkX needed. Stored as `.workflows/.knowledge/graph.json`, queried with JS traversal functions bundled into `knowledge.cjs`.

## Layer 3: Git Intelligence (Change Patterns)

Git history analysis — cheap to compute (git log parsing), no dependencies, high signal:

- **Hotspots**: Files that change most frequently (active development or instability)
- **Co-change coupling**: Files that always change together (hidden dependencies the AST might not capture — e.g., a config file and the module that reads it)
- **Stability**: Modules that haven't changed in months/years (stable foundations or dead code)
- **Recent activity**: What's being actively worked on across the team
- **Churn**: Files with high add+delete ratios (might indicate thrashing / unclear design)

## Layer 4: Test Map

Which tests cover which code. Three sources, cheapest to richest:

- **AST-derived**: Test files import source files → basic mapping. Free if the graph exists.
- **Convention-derived**: `auth.test.ts` tests `auth.ts`, `tests/services/` mirrors `src/services/`. Heuristic, usually accurate.
- **Coverage-derived**: Actual line-level coverage data from test runs. Precise but requires running tests with coverage.

## Layer 5: Dependency / Package Layer

What third-party dependencies are used, where, and why. Which services use `bcrypt`, what version, when last updated. Useful for: checking if a similar dep already exists before adding one, understanding impact of upgrades, tracing security advisories to affected modules.

## Layer 6: Schema / Data Model Layer

For projects with databases: current schema (from migration files or ORM models), entity relationships, migration history, model-to-service mapping. Useful for: discussion grounded in actual data model, planning that includes migration tasks, investigation that understands data flow.

## Layer 7: API Surface Tracking

Public interfaces — HTTP endpoints, GraphQL schema, exported functions. What endpoints exist, their methods, params, auth requirements. Breaking change detection: "this PR removes a public method that has 12 call sites."

## Code Citations — Semantic Anchors with Verified References

A key capability across all layers: citing actual code during workflow phases.

### Why Not Line Numbers

Code changes constantly, line numbers drift. Storing `auth.ts:120` and trusting it next week is unreliable.

### Semantic Anchors

The wiki stores semantic references: `AuthService.validateCredentials()` in `src/services/auth.ts`. These are stable across most edits — functions get modified far more often than renamed.

### Two-Step Verified Citation

When a workflow needs to cite code:
1. **Wiki lookup**: "AuthService.validateCredentials is in src/services/auth.ts" (fast, cached)
2. **Verify**: Grep for the function to get current line number (real-time, always accurate)
3. **Present**: `AuthService.validateCredentials() at src/services/auth.ts:127` (verified, current)

If step 2 fails (function moved/renamed), Claude flags it and updates the wiki. The stale reference becomes a self-healing trigger.

### Logic Flow Tracing with Citations

Not just locations — traced logic flow with code evidence. Example from a bugfix investigation:

```
Investigation trace:

1. LoginController.login() receives credentials
   → src/controllers/auth.ts:45-52

2. Calls AuthService.validateCredentials(email, password)
   → src/services/auth.ts:127-148
   Note: fetches user BEFORE checking if account is locked (line 131)

3. PasswordService.verify() compares hashes
   → src/services/password.ts:67-78
   Note: uses user.passwordHash — but after password reset,
   the hash is updated at :82 while the cached user object
   at step 2 still holds the OLD hash (stale read)

4. ROOT CAUSE: AuthService caches user at line 131,
   PasswordService.reset() updates DB at password.ts:82,
   but the cached object isn't refreshed.
```

Once Claude traces a flow during investigation, that trace becomes a wiki flow page. Next time anyone works on the auth system, the flow is already documented. Investigation work compounds — it's institutional knowledge, not throwaway debugging.

## How Workflows Use Code Knowledge (Per-Phase)

### Research / Discussion

Currently: Claude starts with whatever the user tells it. No codebase context.

With code knowledge: Before the discussion starts, contextual queries pull in the architecture overview, relevant module pages, existing flow pages, convention pages. The discussion is grounded in the actual codebase from sentence one. User says "I want rate limiting" and Claude responds knowing where the middleware chain lives, what patterns exist, what the request lifecycle looks like.

### Investigation (Bugfix)

Currently: User describes symptoms, Claude explores the codebase trying to find the relevant code path. Lots of reading, grepping, orienting.

With code knowledge: Claude queries the wiki for relevant flow pages and module pages. Login flow page shows the exact call chain. Investigation becomes targeted instead of exploratory — goes straight to the interaction point between flows, reads current code at those locations, identifies root cause.

### Specification

Currently: Specs describe what to build in abstract terms. The implementer has to re-discover where things live.

With code knowledge: Specs reference actual architecture — specific files to create/modify, patterns to follow, interfaces to extend, existing services to reuse. The spec becomes a bridge between intent and implementation.

### Planning

Currently: Task decomposition is somewhat abstract — "implement the service", "add tests".

With code knowledge: Each task has exact file paths, line references, patterns to follow, dependencies identified. The implementer doesn't need to explore — they have a map. Tasks reference: which file to create/modify, what pattern to follow (with wiki page link), what tests exist (from test map), what dependencies to use.

### Implementation

The implementer gets structural context loaded automatically: which files to create/modify (from plan, grounded in wiki), what patterns to follow (convention pages), what interfaces to implement (module pages), what the surrounding code looks like (flow pages). When something unexpected is encountered, the wiki provides explanation or gets updated.

## Freshness Engine

The piece that makes everything self-maintaining instead of decaying.

### Cheap Tier: Graph + Git Update (Every Commit)

Post-commit or post-merge hook. Runs in seconds, no LLM calls:

1. `git diff --name-only HEAD~1` → list of changed files
2. For each changed source file: re-parse with tree-sitter → updated entities + relationships → diff against previous graph
3. Update `graph.json`
4. Flag affected wiki pages as stale in `metadata.json` with specific change context ("AuthService: new method added, dependency on CacheService added")
5. If test files changed: update test map
6. Update git velocity stats

### Expensive Tier: Wiki Refresh (Lazy or Scheduled)

Wiki pages flagged as stale get refreshed by Claude. Two modes:

**Lazy (default)**: Next workflow session that touches a stale page triggers a refresh. Claude gets the graph diff as context rather than re-reading the whole file. Happens naturally as part of workflow sessions — no extra cost if the page isn't needed.

**Scheduled**: A remote trigger (the `/schedule` skill already exists) runs periodically — e.g., weekly. Refreshes all stale wiki pages in batch. Useful for teams wanting the wiki always current.

### PR Analysis Hook (Team Context)

CI hook on PR merge:
1. Analyze the full PR diff
2. Update graph
3. Generate a PR knowledge summary: modules affected, structural changes, intent from PR description
4. Store as lightweight knowledge artifact
5. Flag wiki pages for refresh

Captures the intent behind changes (from PR descriptions) alongside structural facts (from the diff). PR descriptions capture the "why" that's otherwise lost — nobody reads old PRs, but this archives the intent into the knowledge system.

## The Compound Effect

Each workflow session doesn't just produce its own artifacts — it enriches the shared understanding:

| Session Activity | Wiki Contribution |
|---|---|
| Bugfix investigation | New flow page tracing the call chain |
| Feature discussion | Updated module page with new dependencies |
| Implementation | Updated conventions from patterns discovered |
| Code review | Corrected stale wiki entries |

After months of active use, the wiki is a comprehensive, verified, evolving map of the codebase that no single developer could maintain manually. All queryable via semantic search (KB) and structural traversal (graph).

## Suggested Implementation Phasing

Ordered by value and dependency:

1. **Wiki + bootstrap analysis** — immediate cold-start value, no new deps, fits into existing KB architecture
2. **Git intelligence** — cheap to compute, high signal, no new deps
3. **AST graph via tree-sitter WASM** — significant build work but unlocks structural queries and verified citations
4. **Graph-enhanced wiki** — connect wiki and graph, graph grounds the wiki in structural fact
5. **CI hooks (cheap tier)** — freshness engine for graph + staleness flags
6. **Test map** — AST-derived initially, coverage-derived later
7. **Scheduled wiki refresh** — batch updates via remote triggers
8. **PR analysis hook** — intent capture from merged PRs
9. **Dependency / schema / API surface layers** — project-type-specific, lower priority

Items 1-2 could be part of the KB implementation or immediately after. Item 3 is the big capability jump. Items 4-9 layer incrementally.

## Open Question: Standalone Product

This system has potential scope beyond the workflow system. The code wiki, AST graph, freshness engine, and verified citations could serve any AI-assisted development tool — not just agentic-workflows. Whether this should be a separate product (consumed by workflows as a dependency) or built into the workflow system directly is an open design question to explore.
