# Output Format Contract

Every output format adapter is a directory of 5 files, each serving a specific concern.

## Required Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `about.md` | Format identity, setup, and storage layout |
| `authoring.md` | Creating tasks and setting their properties |
| `reading.md` | Extracting tasks and determining work order |
| `updating.md` | Modifying tasks — status, content, properties |
| `graph.md` | Task graph — priority and dependencies across tasks |

## File Specifications

### about.md

Provides everything needed to evaluate and initialise the format.

Must include:

- **Format name and description** — what this format is
- **Benefits** — why choose this format
- **Setup** — installation, configuration, prerequisites
- **Output Location** — where tasks are stored
- **Structure Mapping** — how workflow concepts (topic, phase, task) map to the format's entities

### authoring.md

Instructions for creating individual tasks. This file is used by the task authoring agent, which works on one task at a time in isolation. It must NOT contain priority or dependency information — those are set later by the graphing agent using graph.md.

Must include:

- **Task Storage** — how to create a task (file path, API call, etc.) with a complete example showing the full task template
- **Task Properties** — properties set during authoring:
  - **Status** — available values and their meanings
  - **Phase grouping** — how tasks are grouped into phases
  - **Labels/tags** — categorisation available beyond phases
- **Flagging** — how to mark tasks as needing clarification
- **Cleanup (Restart)** — how to delete all authored tasks for a topic

### reading.md

Instructions for extracting tasks and determining work order.

Must include:

- **Listing Tasks** — how to retrieve all tasks for a plan. Returns summary-level information (id, title, status, phase, priority, dependencies) suitable for building a task graph or overview. Format-specific filtering and query capabilities may be documented here.
- **Extracting a Task** — how to read full task detail including all properties
- **Next Available Task** — how to determine the next task to work on. Document how the format uses status, priority, dependencies, and phase ordering to determine sequence.

### updating.md

Instructions for modifying tasks.

Must include:

- **Status Transitions** — how to change task status. Document all supported statuses (e.g., complete, skipped, cancelled) and how to set each one.
- **Updating Task Content** — how to modify a task's title, description, or other properties after creation.

### graph.md

Instructions for establishing priority and dependencies across tasks. This file is used by the graphing agent after all tasks have been authored. The agent receives the complete plan and uses this file to build the task execution graph.

Must include:

- **Priority** — available levels, how to set priority on a task, and how to remove it.
- **Dependencies** — how to declare that one task depends on another. Must support multiple dependencies per task.
  - **Adding a Dependency**
  - **Removing a Dependency**
