<!-- Instructions for establishing priority and dependencies across tasks -->
<!-- This file is used by the graphing agent after all tasks have been authored -->

## Priority

{Priority mechanism — levels available, how to assign, what happens if omitted}

## Dependencies

{Whether cross-topic dependencies use the same mechanism or require different handling}

## Querying

### Find Tasks With Dependencies

{How to find tasks that depend on other tasks}

### Check if a Dependency is Resolved

{How to check whether a blocking task is complete}

### Find Unblocked Work
