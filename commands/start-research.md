description: Start a research exploration using the technical-research skill. For early-stage ideas, feasibility checks, and broad exploration before formal discussion.

Invoke the **technical-research** skill for this conversation.

Then ask these questions to kickstart the exploration:

1. **What's on your mind?**
   - What idea or topic do you want to explore?
   - What prompted this - a problem, opportunity, curiosity?

2. **What do you already know?**
   - Any initial thoughts or research you've done?
   - Constraints or context I should be aware of?

3. **Where should we start?**
   - Technical feasibility? Market landscape? Business model?
   - Or just talk it through and see where it goes?

Ask these questions clearly and wait for responses before proceeding. The skill handles everything else.
