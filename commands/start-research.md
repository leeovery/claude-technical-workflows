description: Start a research exploration using the technical-research skill. For early-stage ideas, feasibility checks, and broad exploration before formal discussion.
---

Invoke the **technical-research** skill for this conversation.

Before beginning, ask the user these questions to get the exploration started:

## Essential Information

1. **What's on your mind?**
   - What idea or topic do you want to explore?
   - What prompted this - a problem, opportunity, curiosity?

2. **What do you already know?**
   - Any initial thoughts or research you've done?
   - Constraints or context I should be aware of?

3. **Where should we start?**
   - Technical feasibility? Market landscape? Business model?
   - Or just talk it through and see where it goes?

## After Gathering Information

Once I have this information:
- Ensure research directory exists: `docs/workflow/research/`
- Create `exploration.md` immediately (single file for early research)
- Start exploring using the technical-research skill
- Use `/interview` for structured questioning when needed

## Documentation Discipline

**Document as you go, not at the end.** Follow this loop:

1. Ask a question
2. Discuss the answer
3. Document the insight immediately
4. Commit every 2-3 insights
5. Repeat

Don't batch documentation. Don't save commits for later. Context can refresh at any time—uncommitted work is lost.

This is early-stage exploration. It may lead to building something, or it may not. Both outcomes are valid.

Ask these questions clearly and wait for responses before proceeding.
