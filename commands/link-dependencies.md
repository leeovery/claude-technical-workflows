# Deprecated Command

⚠️ **`/link-dependencies` is deprecated.** Use `/workflow:link-dependencies` instead.

The command has been renamed to use the `workflow:` prefix to distinguish workflow commands from standalone commands.

---

**Forwarding to `/workflow:link-dependencies`...**

Run the `/workflow:link-dependencies` command now.
