# Progressive Disclosure Conventions

**DEPRECATED** — These conventions have been consolidated into CLAUDE.md. See:

- **Skill File Structure (Progressive Disclosure)** — backbone structure, load directives, reference files, navigation patterns
- **Structural Conventions** — stop gates, heading hierarchy, step numbering, conditionals, navigation arrows
- **Display & Output Conventions** — rendering instructions, menus, tree structures, status terms

This file is kept for historical reference only. CLAUDE.md is the authoritative source.
